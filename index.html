        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a Spanish/Italian American born and bred in Olympia, Washington. I studied Music Production at Valencia College.</p>
        <p>In the past, I spent many years teaching my community how to create with technology at Apple. I also regularly worked to troubleshoot and repair devices
          for our returning customers. It was there that I learned about the impact of the customer journey, and what goes into building a brand from the front-line of support.
        </p>
        <p>It's no surprise that I'm a bit of a nerd. I love camera gear and instruments, and I get much joy out of them when I get to create and collaborate with
          other creatives. I have a passion for yoga and meditation, and I enjoy spending my mornings with my cat Marvolo. Yes, if you caught that, I'm a bit of
          a Harry Potter nerd as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's a bit about me, in a nutshell. If you'd like to know more about me, you can view my daily musings on my

        <h2>Goals</h2>
